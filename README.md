# GB Horror
In a tale as old as time, where scare monsters lurk inside ones closet. A boy with the without fright wanders through his own, by surprise he's sucked into a void to another realm. His fearlessness rendered nill, his pride swept under the rug, his angst reaching new limits where even the cutest doll is causing anxiety. Just before he succumbs to his new overwelming sensation of fear. His memories so fond of the unknown, gives him insentive to push on and face on anything to get back on top.
